**Image-Super-Resolution**

Image super-resolution is the technique used to convert low-resolution images to high-resolution
images. This is particularly useful in medical fields, for instance, in identifying tumors within the
body, as well as in enhancing images generated by satellites and in various other applications. 1
While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to be highly effective for image
processing due to their local receptive fields and shared weights, Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN)-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image
super-resolution by employing CNN-based generator and discriminator networks. However,
these methods have a limited ability to inherently model long-range dependencies and global
context within an image, a capability offered by transformers through their self-attention
mechanism. To leverage the strengths of both GANs and transformers, this project utilized
TransGAN, which combines CNNs and transformers to potentially produce superior results. In
this project, image super-resolution was performed using CNNs, GANs, and TransGAN on
Divand the results were compared. The findings indicate that TransGAN outperformed both
CNNs and GANs in terms of PSNR and SSIM values.
